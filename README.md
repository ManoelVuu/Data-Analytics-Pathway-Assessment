# Predicting Term Deposit Subscription
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit, based on various features in the dataset. The target variable, "y," indicates whether the client subscribes ("yes") or not ("no").

So far, the following steps have been completed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis to understand the data, uncover patterns, and identify correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creation and evaluation of relevant features to improve model performance.

In the next phase, a predictive model will be built and evaluated using the processed data.

This repository contains the project files, including the EDA and feature engineering steps, with plans for further development in model building and evaluation.
